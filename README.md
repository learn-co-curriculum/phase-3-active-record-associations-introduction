# Introduction to Active Record Associations

Previously, we worked through object-relational mapping and building Ruby
classes that can represent SQL records. Active Record is like an automation and
simplification of those concepts.

Active Record is the interface that gives you the tools to link a database to your
application. It lets you structure your data models in a logical and nearly
plain-English way.

We'll cover topics that will include answers to these questions:

- What are the advantages of using Active Record?
- What are the features of Rake?
- What are common methods accessible through Active Record associations?
- How do you use association macros?

Having a solid understanding of Active Record will make persisting data much
easier. This will replace the need for a lot of the custom code we wrote in when
creating ORMs. We’ll cover working with models, setting them up, and building
associations between them. Over the next several lessons, we'll explain Active
Record and work through a few labs that will help reinforce these concepts.
